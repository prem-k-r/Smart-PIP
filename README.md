# Levisio  

**Smart Picture-in-Picture for YouTube that Leviates with You**

Levisio is a lightweight Chrome extension that enables Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode for any YouTube tab — even if it doesn't natively support PiP. It captures the video stream and displays it in a floating window that stays on top, giving you maximum multitasking power.

## ✨ Features

- 🖼️ Enable Picture-in-Picture on any YouTube tab
- 🚀 Auto PiP
        Automatically triggers PiP when you switch away from a playing YouTube tab.
- 🧠 Smart Close (Optional)
        Automatically exits PiP when you return to the YouTube tab.

## 🧩 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer Mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `Levisio` folder.
5. Click the Levisio icon in the toolbar to start PiP on the current tab.

## 🛠️ Permissions Used

- Zero permissions beyond what's necessary

🛡️ Privacy & Performance
Levisio doesn’t collect any user data. It runs entirely in your browser and only on YouTube domains (youtube.com/*), keeping it focused and efficient.
